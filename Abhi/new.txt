SPARK
characteristics
1. very fast-upto 100 times faster than hadoop
2. can be used with any file sys.
3. more interactive than hadoop
4. loads the entire data on RAM thus making it faster

Framework of spark
=>program
=>library- SparkR + GraphX + Streaming + MLLib etc. All APIs included however in hadoop all softwares are to be separately
installed
=>management- uses cluster managers of diff types like that of hadoop or its own
=>storage- can use any file system

Modes
1 Batch
2 Iterative
3 Interactive
4 Streaming

RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
1 immutable
2 lazy evaluation
3 caching
4 type interference


DAG SCHEDULER 

When any action is called on the RDD, Spark creates the DAG and submits it to the DAG scheduler.

The DAG scheduler divides operators into stages of tasks. A stage is comprised of 
tasks based on partitions of the input data. The DAG scheduler pipelines operators together. 
For e.g. Many map operators can be scheduled in a single stage. The final result of a DAG scheduler is a set of stages.
The Stages are passed on to the Task Scheduler.The task scheduler launches tasks via cluster manager. The task 
scheduler doesn't know about dependencies of the stages.
