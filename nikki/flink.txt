Flink is the next generation Big Data tool 
and also known as 4G of Big Data. 
It can do easily:
*Batch Processing
*Interactive processing
*Real-time stream processing
*Graph Processing
*iterative Processing
*In-memory processing

Flink is an alternative of MapReduce,
 it processes data more than 100 times faster than MapReduce. 
Flink is independent of Hadoop 
but it can use HDFS to read, write, store, process the data.
Flink does not provide its own data storage system. 
It takes data from distributed storage.

MODES:
**Local mode – On single node, in single JVM
**Cluster – On a multi-node cluster,
                     with following resource manager.
      *Standalone – This is the default resource manager which is shipped with Flink.
      *YARN – This is very popular resource manager, it is part of Hadoop, introduced in Hadoop 2.x
      *Mesos – This is a generalized resource manager.
