# ZooKeeper is a distributed co-ordination service to manage large set of hosts.

# Co-ordinating and managing a service in a distributed environment is a complicated process.ZooKeeper solves this issue with its simple architecture and API.

# ZooKeeper allows developers to focus on core application logic without worrying about the distributed nature of the application.

# The ZooKeeper framework was originally built at Yahoo for accessing their applications in an easy and robust manner.

 Later, Apache ZooKeeper became a standard for organized service used by Hadoop, HBase, and other distributed frameworks.

 For example, Apache HBase uses ZooKeeper to track the status of distributed data.


@@ DISTRIBUTED APPLICATION----------



A group of systems in which a distributed application is running is called a Cluster and each machine running in a cluster is called a Node.

A distributed application has two parts, Server and Client application.

 * Server applications are actually distributed and have a common interface so that clients can connect to any server in the cluster and get the same result.

 * Client applications are the tools to interact with a distributed application.

@@ BENIFITS-------------------



    * Reliability - Failure of a single or a few systems does not make the whole system to fail.

    * Scalability - Performance can be increased as and when needed by adding more machines with minor change in the configuration of the application with no downtime.

    * Transparency - Hides the complexity of the system and shows itself as a single entity / application.


QUES. WHAT IS APACHE ZOOKEEPER MEANT FOR??

ANS. Apache ZooKeeper is a service used by a cluster to coordinate between themselves and maintain shared data .

 ZooKeeper is itself a distributed application providing services for writing a distributed application.



@@ COMMON SERVICES PROVIDED BY ZOOKEEPER------------


 * Naming service - Identifying the nodes in a cluster by name. 

 * Configuration management - Latest and up-to-date configuration information of the system for a joining node.

 * Cluster management - Joining / leaving of a node in a cluster and node status at real time.

 * Leader election - Electing a node as leader for coordination purpose.

 *  Locking and synchronization service - Locking the data while modifying it.  

 *  Highly reliable data registry - Availability of data even when one or a few nodes are down.



@@ BENIFITS OF ZOOKEEPER-------------





    * Simple distributed coordination process

    * Synchronization 

    * Ordered Messages

    * Serialization

    * Reliability

    * Atomicity 


@@ APLLICATIONS OF ZOOKEEPER-----------------




* YAHOO------:          YAHOO  needs to meet requirements such as data transparency, better performance, robustness, centralized configuration, and coordination.

                         So, they designed the ZooKeeper framework to meet these requirements.

* APACHE HADOOP------:  Hadoop relies on ZooKeeper for configuration management and coordination.


* APACHE HBASE-------:  Apache HBase uses ZooKeeper to track the status of distributed data throughout the master and region servers with the help of centralized configuration management .


* APACHE SOLR----:      it is a fast, open source search platform written in Java.

                        Solr extensively uses every feature of ZooKeeper such as Configuration management, Leader election, node management, Locking and syncronization of data.
