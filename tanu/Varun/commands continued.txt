			Few helpful commands in linux

 -apropos (term) {if you dont know the command for an action}
 -cd {home directory}
 -cd - {previous directory}
 -ls /dir1 /dir2/........{to list more than one directory}
   for home directory '~'can be used
 -use wildcards to find files
    for eg: sdf?? {starts with sdf followed by a character}
            [sdf]* {starting with either s,d or f}
            *[[:lower:]] {ending with lower case letter}
 -type {how a command will be  interpreted}
 -which {which file will be executed}
 -alias {to save time a long command can be given an alias}
   for eg:
          alias me='cd Desktop; mkdir gr8 ;ls-a; gedit asd'
          here me is replacement of the command 
 -we can also write many commands together by separating them with';'
 for eg: comm1 ;comm2; comm3
 -whatis {brief description of the given command}
		

				Doubt?
 Why do we change ownership when we can provide users access through chmod 777?
