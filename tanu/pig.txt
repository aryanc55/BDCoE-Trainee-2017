                          APACHE PIG

open source high level dataflow system.
introduced by yahoo.
provides abstraction over map reduce.

*WHY GO FOR PIG WHEN MR IS THERE?

ANS. 1.) pig uses 1/20 lines of code then the codes used in MR.
     2.)development time gets reduced

* DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PIG AND MR?

PIG-:
a.) high level dataflow.
b.) no need to write complex programs.
c.)built in support for data opt. like join,filter etc.
d.) provides nested datatypes like tuples,maps,bags.

MR-:
a.)low level.
b.) need to write program in java/python.
c.) performing data opt in MR is humongous task.
d.) nested datatypes are not there.

*ADVANTAGES OF APACHE PIG-:

a.)can take any datatype. 
b.)easty to learn,write and read.
c.) extensible by UDF

@@SCOOP----
tool through which one can move from RDMS to HDFS and vice versa.


*ARCHITECTURE-:
pig latin language---->gruntshell---->parser----->optimizer------->compiler--------->execution engine------>MR----->HDFS


*RUNNIG MODES------

1. MR--: default mode,command: PIG
2. LOCAL MODE---: command: PIG -x local

* DATA MODELS------
$ atom ->> basic datatypes
$ tuple->>set of fields
$ bag->> collection of set of tuples
$ map->> key value pairs

*PIG OPERATORS----

# LOAD
# FOREACH
# FILTER
# JOIN
# ORDER BY
# STORE
# DISTINCT
# GROUP
# COGROUP
