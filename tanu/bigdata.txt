BIG DATA

collection of data sets so large and complex that becomes difficult to process using on hand database system tools.

1. EVOLUTION OF DATA-:

# evolution of technology
# social media
# IOT

2. HOW TO CONSIDER A DATA IS BIG DATA?

* 5 v'S OF DATA-

#Volume
#variety - @ structured
           @ semi- structured
           @ un-structured
#velocity
#value
#veracity ( uncertainity and inconsistency in the data)

3.HOW TO USE BIG DATA AS OPPORTUNITY?

#cost reduction
# faster and better decision making
# improved services or products

4. PROBLEMS OF BIGDATA

#Storing exponentially growing huge datasets.
#processing data having complex structure.
#processing data faster.

HADOOP - AS - SOLUTION...

hadoop ( a framework that allows to store and process large data in parallel and distributed format )

TWO COMPONENTS-:

# HDFS (hadoop distributed file system)

store across the cluster

# MAP REDUCE

store across HDFS.

HDFS has two components-:
@ namenode ( that contains metadata)
@  datanode ( data is stored)

5.HOW HDFS SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF BIGDATA ?

# data is stored in nodes by dividing into blocks.
# solve scaling problem.
# store all kinds of data.
# follow WORM ( write over read many)
# provides parallel processing of data.

6. HADOOP ECOSYSTEM-:
#  apache hive
# apache pig
# spark
# hbase
