Big data
•	It describes large volume of data both structured and unstructured and certain advanced data analytics method to extract value from data.
•	10 v of it are volume(data measured in gb,tb),velocity(speed at which data is generated,refreshed),variety(bigdata handle structured,unstructured and semi structured data),variability(same data but meaning is constantly changing),veracity(refer to reliability of data source),validity(refer to how accurate and correct data is),vulnerability(security concerns),volatility(means how long you need to store data),value(getting value from data),visualization(to visualize data in graph and trees)
•	Gzip file-it is a file format and a software application used for compression and decompression of files.

#tar.gz file is usually called tarball.
•	zip file and gzip file are not same because zip file compress file individually and cannot take advantage of redundancy between files.
•	MapReduce-it’s a processing technique and a program model for distributed computing based on java and it consist 2 task i.e. map and reduce.
#map takes set of data and convert it into another set where individual element are broken into key/value pair
