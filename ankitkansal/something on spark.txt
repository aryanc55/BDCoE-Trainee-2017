hadoop supports storage via hdfs and processes via mapreduce.
spark is only for procrsses.
spark is replacement of mapreduce
spark was needed for large amt of unstructured data.
for storage,  spark can use hdfs or any other storage.
Spark is nearly 10 to 100 times faster than hadoop.
it loads all data to ram during processing.
Spark supports 4 languages : 
scala
python 
r
java

libraries of spark :
spark SQL
Blink DB
Streaming
MLLib
Spark R

Spark has its own management layer(Spark Standalone) like Yarn.

why Spark superceeded Spark

near to live processing
iterative computing
interactive query
faster
all in one(libraries)
easy and smaller codes
compatibility
smarter memory usage(LRU(least recently used))

Modes of Spark::
iterative
batch  
interactive
streaming

fault tolerant

RDD(resilient distributrd database)
immutable
lazy evaluation
caching
type interference


directed acyclic graph makes it faster.

catalyst optimiser

rdd-> transformation----------> rdd

Spark is near to real processing
fling is real processing


Master-- driver and spark context
cluster manager
worker -- executer , task and cache
